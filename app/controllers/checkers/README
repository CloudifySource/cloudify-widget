this package is meant for controllers that we create just for "test now" buttons.


for example - "send email with mandrill" to see that you have setup your mandrill details correctly.

no need for these controllers to pollute the REAL controllers of the application.

each one should be really small and test a specific scenario.

They should not be used to any other flow.
